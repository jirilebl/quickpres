# quickpres

HTML scrolling presentation for math classes with LaTeX syntax for math.
Simple syntax converted into HTML that is displayed with a web browser.
The syntax is explained in the sample presentation pres.prs.  You should
run `./quickpres.pl` in this directory to generate pres.html, which you
then view in a browser.  To see the syntax, just view the pres.prs file
in a text editor.
